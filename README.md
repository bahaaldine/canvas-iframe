## prerequisities

Add the below configuration to your kibana.yml file, to allow Kibana to render iframe:

```
csp.rules:
  # current defaults
  - "script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'nonce-{nonce}'"
  - "worker-src blob'"
  - "child-src blob:"
  # New rule for iframes
  - "frame-src https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"
```

## development

See the [kibana contributing guide](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions setting up your development environment. Once you have completed that, use the following yarn scripts.

  - `yarn kbn bootstrap`

    Install dependencies and crosslink Kibana and all projects/plugins.

    > ***IMPORTANT:*** Use this script instead of `yarn` to install dependencies when switching branches, and re-run it whenever your dependencies change.

  - `yarn start`

    Start kibana and have it include this plugin. You can pass any arguments that you would normally send to `bin/kibana`

      ```
      yarn start --elasticsearch.hosts http://localhost:9220
      ```

  - `yarn build`

    Build a distributable archive of your plugin.

  - `yarn test:browser`

    Run the browser tests in a real web browser.

  - `yarn test:mocha`

    Run the server tests using mocha.

For more information about any of these commands run `yarn ${task} --help`. For a full list of tasks checkout the `package.json` file, or run `yarn run`.
